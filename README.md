I'm a fullstack developer, but I prefer working on frontends. I have experience all over the javascript ecosystem, including Next.JS, Vue, React Native and more. 
Lately, I've been working on expanding my breadth of knowledge in mobile development, and learning SwiftUI and participating in the apple development community.
I believe that by learning this framework, I can be a better developer across all platforms. 

- Currently, I am learning SwiftUI, Vue.js, and Supabase
- I'm working at ACME General Corp with a tight-knit group of devs
